# **Introducing the Indie Dev Awards**

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the inaugural **Indie Dev Awards**, a groundbreaking event dedicated to celebrating the incredible talent and innovation of indie software developers worldwide.

For our purposes, an **Indie Developer** is an individual or a small group of people publishing software or innovating in a space without large external funding.
